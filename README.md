This repostitory is a path through my graduate journey at Stanford. I initially enrolled in [Stanford's NDO](https://online.stanford.edu/programs/foundations-computer-science-graduate-certificate) There will be a seperate branch for the specific course, which I will share the projects/content in accordance to course/university policy.
I have the goal of enrolling in the MSCS program. 

4 Classes to focus on: 

- CS103:
  - Attempted to waive due to earning grades in [Intro to Algorithms](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/academics/courses/cs401-120248).
- CS107:
  - https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs107/ ; will take third.
    - Supplementing the pre-requisite with [C++ Accelerated CS Fundamentals](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-fundamentals-1/lecture/q5Vpx/1-2-c-classes). 
- CS109:
  - https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs109/ ; will take first in the sequence.
