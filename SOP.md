Growing up in Danville, Illinois, a small town with no AP Computer Science and limited access to basic digital tools like Excel, my exposure to technology was almost nonexistent. I had to build everything from scratch, and worked mowing lawns to pay for my car and clothes. I competed with others with objectively greater resources, and privledges. I attended community college while working and playing collegiate soccer to afford an education. That journey demanded grit, focus, relentless discipline, but came with academic and mental-health tradeoffs. I’ve never had a straight line to success—but each challenge sharpened my intellectual curiosity and sense of purpose.

My early setbacks at UIUC and Johns Hopkins were formative. They taught me how to rebuild, rethink, and iterate; and to focus on mental health. That resilience carried me into Northwestern’s MSDS program, where I’ve built not only a strong academic record (3.95+ GPA) but a clear technical trajectory: preparing to research and deploy AI systems that scale to real-world constraints. Through courses like Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Unsupervised Learning, and Optimization & Heuristics, I’ve developed expertise in core ML techniques, optimization theory, and structured learning—directly aligning with Stanford’s CS229, CS234, and CS261. My foundation in Math for Data Science strengthens my preparation for CS109 and CS228.

But applied intelligence also needs systems fluency. To this end, I’ve created a CUDA + AI alignment repo to guide a sequence of courses centered around real-time, GPU-accelerated RL on distributed edge systems. I plan to take CS144 and EE282 to understand the memory, networking, and architectural bottlenecks in deploying reinforcement learning agents in grid or IoT environments—an area I’m already exploring in my MSDS capstone. Pairing this with CS149 will enable practical CUDA development and multi-agent parallelism. My upcoming course in Intelligent Systems and Robotics will further integrate systems-level reasoning and RL in physical or simulated space.

Together, these courses satisfy the Stanford MSCS breadth areas—A (CS261, CS228), B (CS144, EE282), and C (CS221)—and fulfill the AI depth specialization, while building a portfolio tailored to edge AI and grid reinforcement learning. Beyond checking requirements, they represent the foundation for a career at the intersection of scalable ML, real-time systems, and responsible deployment - even aligning with my outer purpose - to build stability and minimize chaos in environments I'm apart of. 

Stanford is the natural next step not just because of its unmatched resources, but because of its culture of intellectual rigor and interdisciplinary AI research. I’m not here because I’ve had the most polished path—I’m here because I’ve grown through every part of mine. I’m ready to contribute that same persistence, creativity, and purpose to Stanford’s MSCS program; and to bring those character traits to my peers, mentors, and colleagues.
