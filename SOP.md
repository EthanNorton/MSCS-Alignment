My academic path reflects a deliberate progression from machine learning implementation to systems-level AI optimization, culminating in a Stanford MSCS plan grounded in reinforcement learning, optimization, and edge-scale deployment. Through the Northwestern MSDS, I’ve taken foundational and advanced courses that directly support Stanford’s prerequisites and research-intensive focus. Courses like MSDS 422: Machine Learning, MSDS 458: Deep Learning, and MSDS 432: Unsupervised Learning developed my practical fluency in model development, representation learning, and generative techniques—all of which underpin Stanford’s CS229 and CS234. In MSDS 460: Optimization and Heuristics, I explored linear, convex, and combinatorial optimization methods, which transition naturally into CS261 (Optimization and Algorithmic Paradigms) at Stanford. Meanwhile, courses like MSDS 401: Math for Data Science provided the statistical and probabilistic foundations that support further work in CS228 (Probabilistic Graphical Models) and CS109 (Probability for Computer Scientists).

To bridge into the systems and infrastructure needed for real-time and scalable AI, I’ve built a CUDA preparation track and implementation repo [MSCS-Alignment](https://github.com/EthanNorton/MSCS-Alignment) that guides my upcoming coursework. My Stanford plan includes CS144 (Computer Networking) and EE282 (Computer Systems Architecture) to understand latency, memory, and throughput challenges inherent in deploying distributed RL agents to grid or edge environments. This will be stengthened by MSDS 464-DL: Intelligent Systems and Robotics, where I could combine with CS149 (Parallel Computing), this track prepares me for practical CUDA/GPU development across multi-agent AI environments. My current MSDS capstone, which focuses on RL and IoT in energy-aware systems, will bridge directly into Stanford’s AI specialization courses: CS221, CS229, CS234, and CS228, with continued research potential in model optimization, grid coordination, and learning in constrained environments.

Collectively, these courses satisfy Stanford’s MSCS breadth requirements across Areas A (CS261, CS228), B (CS144, EE282), and C (CS221), while fully completing the AI depth specialization. My MSDS training gives me an edge in applied AI and statistical reasoning, while my Stanford coursework will sharpen my systems fluency and research capacity—ultimately enabling me to contribute novel methods for grid-based reinforcement learning and scalable, GPU-accelerated edge AI.
