 - close to my current understanding, with finite math, before note previews. 

## [Lecture 1](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs109/lectures/1_Welcome.pdf)

- Course logistics
- Intro to probability/[counting](https://chrispiech.github.io/probabilityForComputerScientists/en/part1/counting/)
- Combinations/Permutations


## [Lecture 2](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs109/lectures/2_Combinatorics.pdf)
- [Combinatorics](https://chrispiech.github.io/probabilityForComputerScientists/en/part1/combinatorics/) 
- More on combinations/permutations with examples
- Multinomials
- Distinct, Indistinct
- Axioms of Probability
 - Sets, **access to view various axioms**
   - 1. probabilty (x) is between 0 and 1.
     2. Probability of a space is 1.
     3. If X + Y are mutually exlusive, the join of E and F are 0, and E + F = E + F (no overlap).
 - Equally Likely Outcomes 

## [Lecture 3](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs109/lectures/3_IntroProbability.pdf)
**study, a bit harder**
- Equally Likely Outcomes
-  Conditional Probability
 - Level: hard, study chain rule
- Intro to Independence


## [Lecture 4](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs109/lectures/4_Independence.pdf)
- Defining Sample Spaces
- Great example to start to practice examples from Lecture 1,2,3 to grasph further material.

- Deeper into Indepence vs. Dependence
- Chain rule for probabilities (needs practice)
- Complements
- De Morgan's Law
- Also Helpful:

- Starts up **Random Variables**
- Also intro to PMF(Probability Mass Function)

 ## [Lecture 5](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs109/lectures/5_Random%20Variables.pdf)

- Discrete RVs (Random Variables)
- Follows up on conditioning vs independence
- Geometric Random Variables
- Binomials and Bernuolli
