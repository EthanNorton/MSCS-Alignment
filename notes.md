# Lectures and other notes are below 

## [Lecture 1](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs109/lectures/1_Welcome.pdf)

- Course logistics
- Intro to probability/[counting](https://chrispiech.github.io/probabilityForComputerScientists/en/part1/counting/)
- Combinations/Permutations


## [Lecture 2](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs109/lectures/2_Combinatorics.pdf)

- More on combinations/permutations with examples
- Multinomials
- Distinct, Indistinct
- Axioms of Probability
 - Sets, **access to view various axioms**
   - 1. probabilty (x) is between 0 and 1.
     2. Probability of a space is 1.
     3. If X + Y are mutually exlusive, the join of E and F are 0, and E + F = E + F (no overlap).
 - Equally Likely Outcomes 

## [Lecture 3](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs109/lectures/3_IntroProbability.pdf)
